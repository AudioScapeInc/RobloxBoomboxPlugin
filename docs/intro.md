## Why We Built It

Audioscape is a small team of developers, sound designers, and composers. We are passionate about raising the bar for audio quality on Roblox. We built a [developer tool for audio search](https://portal.audioscape.ai) , and once we got search working properly there, we thought it would be cool to make it available in a free boombox plugin for music listening. We were surprised at the number of good music tracks available for free on Roblox.

## Why did we release it as a plugin and not a RBXM?

We have a ton of features planned for the boombox, like extending the playlist functionality, a physical boombox, and better search (along with what you all suggest). We felt that a plugin would allow us to iterate faster and push updates out smoother (instead of having to bother devs to manually update their modules), and therefore enable a better experience.


## Custom Controls for Developers

- **Maximum Volume Control:** Set the maximum volume.
- **Player Location:** Specify or make the player movable, and set it to start minimized or maximized.
- **Pre-seed Queue:** Push your own audio selections to the player.
- **Change Accent Colors:** Customize the player's appearance.
